# Vacation rental search engine

A project that aims to help people easily find vacation rentals of all types
(cottages, campsites, etc.) with little to no effort required.

The idea is simple: 
- We crawl thousands of websites and booking pages.
- Users tell us what they're looking for.
- We find matching locations with availabilities, and show them to the users.

We don't manage booking or any other parts of the process: we just help users
find available rentals that match their criteria and availabilities.

## Setting up the project

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies with Composer:
	```bash
	composer install
	```
3. Install the browser drivers:
	```bash
	vendor/bin/bdi detect drivers
	```
